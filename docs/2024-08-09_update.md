# BRAINS: A Python-Based Command-Line AI and Business Role-Playing Simulation

I was 12 years old when I first saw the movie **War Games** in which the main protaganist played by a young Matthew Broderick, is a high school teenager with next level hacker chops.  While his hacking and system penetration into NORAD via dial-up modem was certainly exciting, what really captivated me was the AI agent "WOPR" he encounters.  In our story, a fictional computer scientist had designed a seemingly sentient AI named WOPR (War Operation Plan Response) used in game theory strategy and simulation.  WOPR offered a number of games, including simple **Tic-Tac-Toe**.  But the hidden game our hero discovers is a full simulation of thermo-nuclear war between the Earth's two super powers.  Now apparently, somebody in NORAD engineering got things twisted around in the git commits to PROD, TEST, and DEV, and our AI confuses what should only be 'simulated' game instructions and actions with actual missle launch control system instructions.  There's defintely a Medium article somewhere on this topic of keeping PROD and DEV isolated to avoid catastrophe :D  That is not this article.

Now, in today's lingo, you might say that WOPR was a rule-based expert system with a simulation engine that exhibits some characteristics of reinforcement learning.  ðŸ¤“  The back and forth interactions between our hero and AI are very reminisent of a today's GPTs, where both human and AI are aware of an on-going conversation history with each other.  But unlike a simple ChatBot, with a simple chat history being managed as the core source of context, there are clearly more sophisticated processes going on with WOPR, and beyond that of what today we might be accomplished through a single or even chained set of system prompts.  WOPR was access to a variety of functions, such as controlling missle silos. Doh!  Without going into all the details, these differences put WOPR squarely in the bucket of what we now would call being an AI "Agent".  It is clear that the AI has a level of "contextual comprehension" and awareness, as well as guiding instruction sets that is not transparent or fully understood, and the agent has self-determination around access to these functions.  

Recently, I have found myself really intrigued with this intersection of innovation and nostalgia, blending the tools of today with the inspirations of yesterday. BRAINS: Business Role-Playing and AI Networking Simulation is a project born from that intersection.  A command-line application that merges the retro charm of text-based adventure games like Zork with modern AI and project management principles.

In this article, Iâ€™ll walk you through the initial codebase of BRAINS, highlight the key components, and share the design decisions that went into its early development. If youâ€™re interested in AI, RPGs, game development, or just appreciate a simple but well thought out Python project, this is for you.

## Repository Structure

A well-organized project is key to maintainability and scalability, especially when integrating multiple functionalities like AI, project management, and turn-based gameplay. Hereâ€™s how the BRAINS repository is structured:

```bash
BRAINS/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE
â”œâ”€â”€ setup.py
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test_quest.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test_player.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test_ai_agent.py
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ docs/
    â””â”€â”€ architecture.md
```

This structure lays a beginning foundation for BRAINS thatâ€™s both extensible and easy to navigate. Letâ€™s dive into the key components.

## CLI: The Entry Point

The command-line interface is where it all begins. The `cli.py` file is designed to handle user inputs and initiate the game.

```python
import argparse
from brains.game.quest import Quest
from brains.game.player import Player
from brains.game.ai_agent import AIAgent

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="BRAINS: Business Role-Playing and AI Networking Simulation")
    parser.add_argument('--start', action='store_true', help="Start the game")
    parser.add_argument('--player', type=str, help="Player name")
    args = parser.parse_args()

    if args.start:
        if args.player:
            player = Player(name=args.player)
            print(f"Welcome, {player.name}. Your quest begins!")
            # Start the game loop here
        else:
            print("Please provide a player name using --player <name>")
    else:
        parser.print_help()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Key Points:

argparse: We use argparse to manage command-line arguments, making the interface intuitive and flexible.
Game Initialization: The game starts by creating a Player instance and welcomes the user. The game loop will eventually live here, driving the turn-based mechanics.
Core Classes: Quest, Player, and AIAgent
At the heart of BRAINS are the Quest, Player, and AIAgent classes, each with a specific role in the game.

## Quest Class (quest.py)

```python
import uuid
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import List, Optional

class Quest(BaseModel):
    id: str = Field(default_factory=lambda: str(uuid.uuid4()))
    title: str
    description: str
    dependencies: Optional[List[str]] = None
    acceptance_criteria: Optional[List[str]] = None

    def is_ready_to_start(self, completed_quests):
        if not self.dependencies:
            return True
        return all(dep in completed_quests for dep in self.dependencies)
```

Key Points:

UUIDs for Uniqueness: Each Quest is identified by a UUID, ensuring every quest is unique.
Pydantic for Validation: Pydanticâ€™s BaseModel is used for data validation and management, ensuring that all quests conform to a consistent structure.
Dependencies: Quests can have dependencies, allowing for complex project management scenarios where certain tasks must be completed before others can begin.

## Player Class (player.py)

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List

class Player(BaseModel):
    name: str
    notes: List[str] = []

    def add_notes(self, note: str):
        self.notes.append(note)

    def view_notes(self):
        return "\n".join(self.notes)
```

Key Points:

Note Management: Players can add and view notes, providing a way to track progress, ideas, and strategies. This is a nod to the note-taking aspect of the game, which will be crucial as the project evolves.

## AIAgent Class (ai_agent.py)

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class AIAgent(BaseModel):
    name: str
    model: str
    settings: dict

    def take_turn(self, quest):
        # AI logic goes here, using the model and settings
        print(f"{self.name} is taking its turn...")
        # Simulate some decision making
        decision = f"{self.name} completed the task in {quest.title}."
        return decision
```

Key Points:

AI Integration: The AIAgent class is where the AI-driven gameplay comes to life. Each agent has its own model and settings, allowing for customizable AI behavior. The take_turn method will eventually house the logic for AI decision-making.
JSON Handling with ujson
Given that BRAINS is a JSON-heavy application, efficient JSON handling is critical. Thatâ€™s where ujson comes in.

## JSON Handler (json_handler.py)

```python
import ujson as json

def load_json(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        return json.load(file)

def save_json(file_path, data):
    with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
        json.dump(data, file)
```

Key Points:

Performance: ujson is significantly faster than Pythonâ€™s built-in json module, which is particularly beneficial given the potentially large and complex data structures BRAINS will manage.
Simplicity: The json_handler.py module abstracts the JSON loading and saving processes, making it easy to work with JSON data throughout the application.

## Moving Forward

The initial groundwork for BRAINS is in place, but thereâ€™s a lot more to come. Next steps include:

- Developing the Turn-Based System: Implementing the core game loop where players and AI agents take turns to progress through quests.
- Expanding AI Capabilities: Building out the AI decision-making logic to allow agents to interact with quests and other players intelligently.
- Enhancing Quest Management: Adding features to handle complex quest dependencies, time management, and resource allocation.

This project is still in its early days, but the potential is enormous. Whether youâ€™re interested in retro gaming, AI, RPGs, or innovative project management tools, I believe BRAINS has something to offer. Iâ€™m excited to continue developing this project and welcome any feedback or contributions from the Python community.

Feel free to check out the codebase on GitHub and stay tuned for more updates. Letâ€™s build something amazing together!
