The dynamic relationship matrix is designed to help identify the types of relationships that could exist between different types of notes. Each cell in the matrix outlines potential relationships between the corresponding note types in the rows and columns.

### Example Dynamic Relationship Matrix

### Explanation of the Matrix

- **Hypothesis to Hypothesis**: This explores relationships like comparing two hypotheses or whether one hypothesis refines or expands on another.
  
- **Person to Hypothesis**: Focuses on whether the person is a proponent, opponent, or originator of the hypothesis.

- **Question to Hypothesis**: Looks at whether the question is designed to test or clarify the hypothesis.

- **Evidence to Hypothesis**: Evaluates whether the evidence supports or contradicts the hypothesis.

- **Observation to Hypothesis**: Determines if the observation supports or contradicts the hypothesis.

- **Argument to Hypothesis**: Assesses if the argument supports or counters the hypothesis.

- **Claim to Hypothesis**: Examines if the hypothesis is based on the claim or leads to it.

For each combination, the matrix suggests specific relationships to explore based on the types of notes involved. This approach allows for tailored connections that make sense in context, ensuring that the relationships between notes are meaningful and appropriately classified.
